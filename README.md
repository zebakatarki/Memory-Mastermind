# Memory-Mastermind
This game is designed to enhance the user's memory and recall abilities.
So, memory Mastermind is a game constructed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

To initiate the game, press any key on the keyboard. The game will then flash one of four buttons: red, yellow, green, or blue. The user must click on the button that was flashed.
However, it's important to note that the game flashes only one button at a time. To progress in the game, the user must click on all the previously flashed buttons and the current flashed button in the correct sequence. This process continues, with the game adding a new flashed button in each round, gradually increasing the difficulty.
The game continues until the user clicks the wrong button. When this occurs, a red screen appears with a "Game Over" message, displaying the user's score. To restart, the user can press any key.

Additionally, users can check their high score by clicking the "High Score" button.
